About GreySpots

GreySpots is an online web-based Covid-19 information platform. GreySpots provides a series of functions that can help users gather more information about the Covid-19 outbreak in Victoria. These functions include an integrated map, called Safety Guard; a daily email update service, called Exposure Alert; an intellectual suggestion provider called Crowd Advisor; and a collection of open government data called Covid Informatics. Please check our product video for more details. 

Reasoning Behind GreySpots 

GreySpots was created because of the current Covid-19 outbreak situation in Victoria. News and studies have shown that many people, especially university students in the Melbourne CBD area, are experiencing fears and worries about their surrounding environment. The Victoria government has published information on all the Covid-19 exposure sites, testing and vaccination centres, and the crowded areas in the CBD area. Based on these open data, we can suggest safer places and routes for university students in the CBD area. Therefore, users can avoid exposure sites on their way to work or study and stay safe. Therefore, GreySpots is an excellent web service that aims to keep our users safe from exposure to the COVID-19 virus. 
Main Users of GreySpots

Therefore, the primary targeted audience of GreySpots is the residents living in Victoria who are worried about the Covid-19 outbreak, especially those living in the Melbourne CBD area. Among all residents in this target group, the university students living in Melbourne CBD will be the first to use GreySpots and benefit from it. This is because: (1) GreySpots is a project started by Monash University students, and the builds are based on the understanding of the thinking and psychology of their peers. (2) We, as university students, can reach out to other students more efficiently to promote our idea and platform. (3) We can also improve our website and service because we can receive feedback from them more efficiently.

Importance of GreySpots

The implementation of GreySpots in the future will benefit the society that is under the pressure of COVID-19. Firstly, GreySpots realizes the constructive idea of gathering all the COVID-19 information in one platform. Information provided on governmental websites is scattered and untransparent. Users take a long time searching and redirecting on these websites, while the information they receive may not be helpful. Therefore, GreySpots is practical and convenient to users who find it hard to look for all the information needed. Secondly, as the recovery of Victoria's economy and society is a gradual process, the COVID-19 situation will remain a problem. Therefore, We will need a COVID-19 platform at all times as long as the condition persists. It is foreseeable that more users will benefit from GreySpots as the development and improvement of the platform continue. 

Security, Privacy and Testing

GreySpot development team ensured input validation would be carried out when input from the user is solicited, especially for database queries.  GreySpots uses open data, which is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International, which enables the using and reusing of the data without restrictions granted to an acknowledgement of the source. GreySpots platform is thoroughly tested in all aspects such as security, SQL Injections, user privacy, and the required data management plan is built.

About Future Development and Maintenance

For the future owners of GreySpots, it is important to maintain the current system builds including database, email platforms, front-end web page, etc., as well as keep updating and improving the current version. The system should be managed by experienced IT experts on a day-to-day basis. Detailed information about the system builds is provided in a separate document called GreySpots Support Document, and detailed information about maintenance is also provided in another document called GreySpots Maintenance Document. These two documents can be found in the handover package.
